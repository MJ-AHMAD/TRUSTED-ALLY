Gasket helps developers make frameworks to power their apps. There are several
presets and plugins available with which to make frameworks and construct apps.
The various commands, lifecycles, and structures are all enabled by different
plugins you can choose to use.

If you are new to Gasket, you might want to first give it a spin following the
[Quick Start Guide]. From there, reference the guides to start developing your
apps and making your frameworks.
