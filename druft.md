<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
5. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```

### প্রজেক্ট সেটআপ এবং ম্যানেজমেন্টের জন্য ধাপগুলো:

1. **GitHub প্রজেক্ট তৈরি করুন**:
   - GitHub এ একটি নতুন রিপোজিটরি তৈরি করুন এবং এটিকে Public করুন।
   - রিপোজিটরির সেটিংস এ যান এবং "Projects" ট্যাবে যান।
   - একটি নতুন প্রজেক্ট বোর্ড তৈরি করুন এবং এটিকে আপনার প্রজেক্টের নাম দিন।

2. **প্রাথমিক কাজগুলো যোগ করুন**:
   - আপনার প্রজেক্ট বোর্ডে কলাম যোগ করুন যেমন "To Do," "In Progress," এবং "Done"।
   - প্রতিটি টাস্ক বা কাজের জন্য একটি কার্ড তৈরি করুন। উদাহরণস্বরূপ, "Meta Ads সেটআপ," "Facebook Group API ইন্টিগ্রেশন," "Google Ads সেটআপ," ইত্যাদি।

3. **ডকুমেন্টেশন এবং প্ল্যানিং**:

4. **API এবং কোড ইন্টিগ্রেশন**:
   - আপনার প্রজেক্টের জন্য প্রয়োজনীয় API ইন্টিগ্রেশনগুলো শুরু করুন। 
   - প্রতিটি API এর জন্য ডকুমেন্টেশন পড়ে এবং ডেমো প্রজেক্টগুলো দেখে কোড ইমপ্লিমেন্ট করুন।

আপনার উদ্যোগকে সফল ও সার্থক প্রজেক্টে রূপান্তরিত করার জন্য স্টেপ বাই স্টেপ পরিকল্পনা তৈরি করা অত্যন্ত গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। এখানে কিছু প্রধান ধাপ ও পরামর্শ দেওয়া হলো, যা অনুসরণ করে আপনি প্রজেক্টটি শুরু করতে পারেন:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Start Your Project

#### Step 1: Initial Planning and Setup

1. **Define Objectives and Scope**:
   - প্রজেক্টের লক্ষ্য ও উদ্দেশ্য স্পষ্টভাবে নির্ধারণ করুন।
   - প্রধান ফিচার এবং ফাংশনালিটি সমূহ তালিকাভুক্ত করুন।

2. **Create a Project Directory on Your PC**:
   - আপনার পিসিতে একটি প্রজেক্ট ডিরেক্টরি তৈরি করুন।
   - Visual Studio Code ওপেন করে প্রজেক্ট ডিরেক্টরি সেট করুন।

3. **Initialize Git Repository**:
   - প্রজেক্ট ডিরেক্টরির মধ্যে একটি নতুন Git রেপোজিটরি ইন্সট্যান্সিয়েট করুন।
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

4. **Create Initial Folder Structure**:
   - পূর্বে উল্লেখিত ফোল্ডার স্ট্রাকচারটি সেট করুন।
   - প্রাথমিক ফাইল এবং ফোল্ডার গুলো তৈরি করুন:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p TRUSTED-ALLY/{docs,src/{frontend,backend},config,scripts,tests,assets,resources,marketing,investments}
   touch TRUSTED-ALLY/{README.md,LICENSE.md,.gitignore}
   ```

5. **Commit Initial Structure to Git**:
   - প্রথম কমিটটি করুন:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial project structure setup"
   ```

#### Step 2: Set Up GitHub Repository

1. **Create a New Repository on GitHub**:
   - GitHub এ লগইন করুন এবং একটি নতুন রেপোজিটরি তৈরি করুন।
   - রেপোজিটরির নাম এবং অন্যান্য সেটিংস কনফিগার করুন।

2. **Push Local Repository to GitHub**:
   - আপনার লোকাল রেপোজিটরিটি GitHub এ পুশ করুন:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/TRUSTED-ALLY.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Set Up GitHub Projects (Optional)**:
   - GitHub এ "Projects" ট্যাবে যান এবং একটি নতুন প্রজেক্ট বোর্ড তৈরি করুন।
   - টাস্কগুলো যোগ করুন এবং কলাম অনুযায়ী অর্গানাইজ করুন (যেমন To Do, In Progress, Done)।

#### Step 3: Start Development

1. **Front-End Development**:
   - `src/frontend/` ডিরেক্টরির মধ্যে আপনার ফ্রন্ট-এন্ড কোড লিখুন।
   - React.js ব্যবহার করে কম্পোনেন্ট তৈরি করুন।

2. **Back-End Development**:
   - `src/backend/` ডিরেক্টরির মধ্যে আপনার ব্যাক-এন্ড কোড লিখুন।
   - Node.js ও Express.js ব্যবহার করে API রাউট এবং কন্ট্রোলার তৈরি করুন।

3. **API Integrations**:
   - Meta Ads, Facebook Group API, Google Ads, Microsoft Advertising API ইত্যাদির সাথে ইন্টিগ্রেশন করুন।

4. **Database Setup**:
   - MongoDB বা আপনার পছন্দের ডাটাবেস সেটআপ করুন।
   - `src/backend/models/` ডিরেক্টরির মধ্যে ডাটাবেস মডেল তৈরি করুন।

5. **Testing**:
   - `tests/` ডিরেক্টরির মধ্যে টেস্ট স্ক্রিপ্ট লিখুন।
   - Automated টেস্টিং টুলস ব্যবহার করে আপনার কোড টেস্ট করুন।

#### Step 4: Regular Commits and Pushes

1. **Commit Changes Regularly**:
   - আপনার পরিবর্তনগুলো নিয়মিতভাবে কমিট করুন:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**:
   - পরিবর্তনগুলো GitHub এ পুশ করুন:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

#### Step 5: Collaboration and Feedback

1. **Collaborate with Team Members**:
   - টিম মেম্বারদের সাথে সহযোগিতা করুন এবং তাদের সাথে কাজ ভাগাভাগি করুন।

2. **Collect Feedback**:
   - অন্যান্য সদস্যদের কাছ থেকে ফিডব্যাক সংগ্রহ করুন এবং প্রয়োজনীয় পরিবর্তনগুলি করুন।

#### Step 6: Deployment and Review

1. **Deploy Initial Version for Testing**:
   - Netlify বা GitHub Pages ব্যবহার করে প্রজেক্টের একটি বেটা ভার্সন ডেপ্লয় করুন।
   - ইউজারদের কাছ থেকে ফিডব্যাক সংগ্রহ করুন।

2. **Review and Finalize**:
   - প্রফেশনাল রিভিউ করুন এবং সবকিছু ঠিকঠাক করে নিন।

3. **Final Deployment**:
   - প্রজেক্টের চূড়ান্ত ভার্সন ডেপ্লয় করুন এবং প্রফেশনাল ভাবে পাবলিশ করুন।
