It looks like PowerShell is not recognizing the script file. This can happen due to several reasons, such as the script not being in the current directory or the execution policy settings. Let's go through the steps to ensure everything is set up correctly:

### Steps to Run the PowerShell Script

1. **Ensure the Script is in the Correct Directory**:
   - Make sure `create_project_structure.ps1` is located in `C:\Users\TRUSTEDALLY\ALLY\`.

2. **Set the Execution Policy**:
   - You may need to set the PowerShell execution policy to allow script execution. Run the following command in PowerShell as an administrator:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   - Navigate to the directory where the script is located:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\TRUSTEDALLY\ALLY\
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   - Run the script using the following command:
   ```powershell
   .\create_project_structure.ps1
   ```

### Example PowerShell Commands
Here is the complete set of commands you can run in PowerShell:

```powershell
# Set the execution policy
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Navigate to the directory
cd C:\Users\TRUSTEDALLY\ALLY\

# Run the script
.\create_project_structure.ps1
```

### Additional Tips
- **Check the Script Path**: Ensure that the script file name and path are correct.
- **Run as Administrator**: Make sure you are running PowerShell as an administrator.
- **File Permissions**: Ensure that the script file has the necessary permissions to be executed.

If you follow these steps, you should be able to run your PowerShell script successfully. If you encounter any further issues, feel free to let me know! üòä
